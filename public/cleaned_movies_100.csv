He introduces himself as a 'fauji Sardar' of Jhind, Jhind being a small kingdom in Madhya Pradesh. He says that the to-be king of Jhind, Shankar Singh, is found missing from the kingdom right before his 'abhishek'(oath taking of a king) and this is apparently a conspiracy by his own brother Udit Singh, who wants the kingdom for himself. Earlier too there were two occasions when abhishek was arranged but both the times the king was found missing. Udit is a cruel hearted man, unfit to be a good king. Shankar Singh has his vices too but is a kind hearted person who would care for his citizens and is thus worthy to be the king. Now, coincidentally, Gauri has exactly the same appearance as Shankar Singh(also played by Uttam Kumar). This being the last hope, Sardar requests him to enact the role of the King for the abhishek until he finds the real king. Gauri agrees.The two set off for Jhind. Things aren't easy at the Palace in Jhind. Despite the great luxury of kingly life, Gauri is constantly threatened by Udit and his friend, the dashingly handsome but evil Mayurvahan (Soumitra Chatterjee). The abhishek however takes place successfully in the occasion of which the king is also engaged to Rani Kasturi Bai (Arundhati Devi). While the atmosphere gets more and more tensed, the life of king is at stake, there is also a blooming romance between Kasturi Bai and Gauri. A secret agent unfolds that the king is hidden in the fortress owned by Udit who will murder him as soon as he gets rid of Gauri. Sardar then reveals to Gauri in secret that Gauri deserves the throne as much as Shankar or Udit because they were all the sons of the then-Dewan of Jhind,Kali Shankar Roy. The then-king being issue less, adopted Shankar and Udit as sons. Planning a secret entry to the fortress where king was held prisoner, Gauri fights a battle with Mayurvahan, finally killing him as well as surprising and killing Udit. As he approaches his look-alike Shankar Singh, he has a momentary desire to kill the king, gaining the kingdom himself, he being as deserving by his blood as was Shankar Singh, but his humanity wins over and he approaches the king addressing him as ""Your Highness"". He then bids a last goodbye to Kasturi Bai and rides a horse, heading back to Kolkata.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1073122/,"['Saradindu Bandopadhyay', 'Anthony Hope', 'Tapan Sinha']",['Tapan Sinha'],"['Uttam Kumar', 'Arundhati Devi', 'Soumitra Chatterjee', 'Radhamohan Bhattacharya', 'Tarun Kumar Chatterjee', 'Dilip Roy', 'Sandhya Roy', 'Dhiren Mukherjee', 'Murari Bagchi', 'Sanjukta Banerjee']",1961-06-08,['India'],['B.N.

This year, however, he is afflicted with an infirmity that renders him unable to use his sword. Rather than give up this important commission and let the martial world know of his precarious health he means to entrust the consignment to two young knights in his manor, Hsiang Ting and Yun Piao-Piao. As it happens, these two are also betrothed; clearly they have their swordsmanship in common. At Peerless Manor, everyone is suspicious of malevolent strangers who may be sniffing around the silver transport. So when Le I appears astride a high-quality charger but otherwise clearly down on his luck, Hsiang Ting thinks Le I may be a spy for the bad guys in the Flying Tiger Manor. It doesn't help that Le I and Yun Piao-Piao hit it off right away. Even or especially when Le I saves Yun Piao-Piao from a Flying Tiger thug, Hsiang is not assuaged. Yun Piao-Piao is torn, though it seems that a certain sisterly compassion finally wins the day when she arranges to reunite Le I with his horse. It's a cute horse, and Le I seems rather attached ... When the silver convoy passes by a pagoda that happens to house the Flying Tiger gang, Chiao Hung, the Flying Tiger chief, tries to steal the shipment. To win the day, Hsiang and Le must fight together, despite their mutual disaffection.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064067/,['Kuang Ni'],['Cheh Chang'],"['David Chiang', 'Lung Ti', 'Ching Lee', 'Miao Ching', 'Ku Feng', 'Chung Wang', 'Sing Chen', 'Kang-Yeh Cheng', 'Lei Cheng', 'Yun-Kin Chow']",1969-12-28,['Hong Kong'],['Shaw Brothers'],"['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Mystery', 'Romance']",1969,12,28

tt0065179,Life Love Death,1h 55m,6.9,"""Life, Love, Death"" was made before the abolition of capital punishment in France. Its central message is the inhumanity of the guillotine. The film, which is shot somewhat in a cinema verite style, divides roughly into three acts. In Act One, there is a series of murders of prostitutes in Paris. An obviously deeply disturbed man is hiring these prostitutes and then strangling them. Suspicion falls on François (Amidou), a married man with a child. The police put him under surveillance. (Viewers will recognize the inspector in charge of the team as Marcel Bozzuffi, who would play Popeye Doyle's nemesis in The French Connection a couple of years later.) Ironically, François is experiencing spiritual healing and renewal through the power of love---not with his wife, of course, this being a French film, but through an affair with a beautiful young woman he has met (not a prostitute). But just as this is happening and François seems to have lost the need to commit violent crimes, he is arrested. Act Two is the arraignment, trial and exposition of François's life and history. His recent transformation, of course, makes no impression on the court, and he is sentenced to death by guillotine. Act Three is a documentary-style record of François's last days in prison and his execution. The last scene in the film is an image of the guillotine's blade beginning its descent; it slows and freezes and there is a fade to black, as a voiceover issues a passionate plea for abolition of the guillotine.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065179/,"['Claude Lelouch', 'Claude Pinoteau', 'Pierre Uytterhoeven']",['Claude Lelouch'],"['Amidou', 'Caroline Cellier', 'Janine Magnan', 'Marcel Bozzuffi', 'Pierre Zimmer', 'Catherine Samie', 'Lisette Bersy', 'Albert Naud', 'Jean-Pierre Sloan', 'Nathalie Durrand']",1969-01-31,"['France', 'Italy']","['Les Films 13', 'Les Films Ariane', 'Les Productions Artistes Associés']","['Crime', 'Drama', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']",1969,1,31

tt0067633,Punishment Park,1h 31m,7.7,"""Punishment Park"" is a pseudo-documentary purporting to be a film crews's news coverage of the team of soldiers escorting a group of hippies, draft dodgers, and anti-establishment types across the desert in a type of capture the flag game. The soldiers vow not to interfere with the rebels' progress and merely shepherd them along to their destination. At that point, having obtained their goal, they will be released. The film crew's coverage is meant to insure that the military's intentions are honorable. As the representatives of the 60's counter-culture get nearer to passing this arbitrary test, the soldiers become increasingly hostile, attempting to force the hippies out of their pacifist behavior. A lot of this film appears improvised and in several scenes real tempers seem to flare as some of the ""acting"" got overaggressive. This is a interesting exercise in situational ethics. The cinéma vérité style, hand-held camera, and ambiguous demands of the director - would the actors be able to maintain their roles given the hazing they were taking - pushed some to the brink. The cast's emotions are clearly on the surface. Unfortunately this film has gone completely underground and is next to impossible to find. It would offer a captivating document of the distrust that existed between soldiers willfully serving in the military and those persons who opposed the war peacefully.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067633/,['Peter Watkins'],['Peter Watkins'],"['Patrick Boland', 'Kent Foreman', 'Carmen Argenziano', 'Luke Johnson', 'Katherine Quittner', 'Scott Turner', 'Stan Armsted', 'Mary Ellen Kleinhall', 'Mark Keats', 'Gladys Golden']",1972-02-10,['United States'],"['Churchill Films', 'Françoise Films']","['Political Thriller', 'Drama', 'Thriller']",1972,2,10

The film alternates among different kinds of shot with a view to establishing the most suitable view of the narrative: shots from motorcycles, which are able to convey the motion of the race and provide close ups of the riders in the style of television cycle race reporting; fixed cameras stationed at strategically important points along the route, where viewers can watch riders passing in real time and thus gain a clear overview of the distance between the leaders and the main field: and the Olympian eye of the helicopter shots.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0193171/,['Jørgen Leth'],['Jørgen Leth'],"['David Saunders', 'Roger De Vlaeminck', 'Marc Demeyer', 'Freddy Maertens', 'Eddy Merckx', 'Ole Ritter']",1977-02-25,['Denmark'],['Steen Herdel Filmproduktion'],"['Sports Documentary', 'Documentary', 'Sport']",1977,2,25

Apostol, an architect on this side of forty, meets by chance Bella at a swimming pool on the night of her graduation party. The generation gap is a wide one, but Bella falls sway to his intelligence, friends, his life-style and the respect everybody shows for her. Boyan is an actor and comic impersonator. The complex relationships among the three characters hover between friendship and love and involve certain professional motifs. The architect, an even-tempered man, is dispirited because the bold design decisions he has been taking have been regularly rejected. The overly playful actor surrounded by dummies and stage-pros, builds his life exclusively on outer effects. But deep inside he is sad because he knows that he has no real talent. Bella, unexpectedly mature for her age, cannot remain indifferent to the falsehoods and the indifferent attitude to life. She is in conflict with her own mother - a shallow television journalist. Bella's unconscious protest finds its real bearings only when she gets a glimpse of anti-fascist past of the architect who is already infatuated with her. At the end, she marries his best friend, Boyan, though Apostol would be the most important person in her lifetime. The film is notable for the vivid symbolism of its imagery.

Born Jean-Baptiste Poquelin in 1622, the son of a prosperous tapestry maker. His mother died when he was a boy. Growing up in the teeming streets of 17th century Paris, Jean Baptiste received a good Jesuit education and was fascinated by the street fairs and traveling carnivals that flourished in spite of the religious repression and hypocrisy of those cruel times. As a young man he joined the theatrical Bejart family to establish the Illustre-Theatre, which soon went bankrupt. The troupe reformed, found patronage, and went on the road for thirteen years, performing all over France. Poquelin developed his stagecraft adapting Commedia dell Arte plots to please brutalized peasants and cynical townspeople. He also married Madeline Bejart, the widowed daughter of the troupe's founder. Later he entered into a love affair with Mme Bejart's daughter, to the dismay of all. The troupe eventually returned to Paris and, on October 24, 1658, greatly impressed the 20-year old King Louis XIV, later to be called the Sun King. Moliere's life became bound up with the magnificent court at Versailles, and with its intrigues. He wrote, staged and acted in the plays now famous all over the world. He fought with his enemies and his friends, enjoyed success followed by failure, organized court festivities and defended himself against increasingly fanatic religious authorities.

tt0084476,Parsifal,4h 15m,7.6,"Richard Wagner's last opera has remained controversial since its first performance for its unique, and, for some, unsavory blending of religious and erotic themes and imagery. Based on one of the medieval epic romances of King Arthur and the search for the holy grail (the chalice touched by the lips of Christ at the last supper), it recounts over three long acts how a ""wild child"" unwittingly invades the sacred precincts of the grail, fulfilling a prophecy that only such a one can save the grail's protectors from a curse fallen upon them. Interpreters of the work have found everything from mystical revelation to proto-fascist propaganda in it. Hans-Jurgen Syberberg's production doesn't avoid either aspect, but tries synthesize them by seeking their roots in the divided soul of Wagner himself. The action unfolds on a craggy landscape which turns out to be a gigantic enlargement of the composer's death mask, among deliberately tatty theatrical devices: puppets, scale models, magic-lantern projections. The eponymous hero is sung by the specified tenor voice (Reiner Goldberg) but mimed on screen by a male and a female performer alternately, reflecting what the director takes to be the creator's own sexual conflicts. Syberberg's pacing, dictated by the majestic pace of Wagner's score, is slow, but enlivened by constant subtle shifts in point of view, and memorable performances by actress Edith Clever as the villainess/heroine Kundry (sung by Yvonne Minton), orchestra conductor Armin Jordan as the remorseful knight Amfortas (sung by Wolfgang Schoene), and Robert Lloyd (the faithful retainer Gurnemanz).",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084476/,['Richard Wagner'],['Hans-Jürgen Syberberg'],"['Edith Clever', 'Martin Sperr', 'Robert Lloyd', 'Michael Kutter', 'Karin Krick', 'Aage Haugland', 'Armin Jordan', 'Rudolph Gabler', 'Urban von Klebelsberg', 'Bruno Romani-Versteeg']",1982-05-19,"['West Germany', 'France']","['TMS Film GmbH', 'Bayerischer Rundfunk (BR)', 'Gaumont']","['Drama', 'Music']",1982,5,19

tt0093295,Jane B. for Agnes V.,1h 39m,7.2,"""I'll look at you, but not at the camera. It could be a trap,"" whispers Jane Birkin shyly into Agnès Varda's ear at the start of JANE B. PAR AGNES V. The director of CLEO FROM 5 TO 7 and VAGABOND once again paints a portrait of a woman, this time in a marvelously Expressionistic way. ""It's like an imaginary bio-pic,"" says Varda. Jane, of course, is the famed singer (""Je t'aime ... Moi non plus""), actress (BLOW UP), fashion icon (the Hermes Birkin bag) and longtime muse to Serge Gainsbourg. As Varda implies, JANE B. PAR AGNÈS V. abandons the traditional bio-pic format, favoring instead a freewheeling mix of gorgeous and unexpected fantasy sequences. In each, Jane inhabits a new character, playing a cat & mouse game with Varda as they explore the role of the Muse and the Artist, all the while showcasing the multifaceted nature of Birkin's talent. ""I'd like to be filmed as if I were transparent, anonymous, like everyone else,"" says Birkin. But her wish to be a ""famous nobody"" is impossible to achieve; Birkin is simply too magnificent, too mesmerizing. Here, Varda's signature mix of aesthetic innovation and generosity of emotion results in a surreal and captivating essay on Art, Fame, Love, Children and Staircases. For its first-ever U.S. theatrical release the film has been newly-restored from the original 35mm camera negative, overseen by director Varda herself.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093295/,['Agnès Varda'],['Agnès Varda'],"['Jane Birkin', 'Jean-Pierre Léaud', 'Philippe Léotard', 'Farid Chopel', 'Alain Souchon', 'Serge Gainsbourg', 'Laura Betti', 'Monique Godard', 'Ian Marshall', 'Les enfants Tooke']",1988-03-02,['France'],"['Ciné-tamaris', 'La Sept Cinéma']","['Biography', 'Fantasy']",1988,3,2

tt0096464,A World Apart,1h 53m,7.0,"1963. Thirteen year old Molly Roth, the eldest of three offspring of Gus and Diana Roth, lives a carefree life as part of the affluent white minority in South Africa. Race is a non-issue for her as although, under apartheid, the Roths largely exist among other white people like them, she feels equally comfortable around the black people in her life, such as their servants and her parents' black friends. Beyond knowing that they are busy in their work, Molly is unaware of the full extent of what her parents do, Gus a leading member of the South African Communist Party and Ruth an anti-apartheid journalist who also secretly works for the underground in support of the outlawed African National Congress. Shortly after Gus quietly escapes the country to evade probable arrest by the government - Molly believing it just a short work related trip - Molly's carefree life starts to unravel when Diana is detained for ninety days under a new law that allows such detention without ever even being charged with a criminal offense. The goal of Diana's interrogators, led by Inspector Muller, is to get her to divulge details especially of the underground, most specifically proverbial ""names"". Beyond missing her mother, Molly begins to resent the anti-apartheid work which has directly and indirectly impacted her life in a negative way, she wanting a mother, not an activist-mother. As the situation with Diana evolves, which includes someone needing to act as caregivers to Molly and her younger sisters while Diana is in detention, Molly gets a broader perspective of her situation under apartheid as she is able to see more of life just outside her protected white enclave, and as she is made aware of what Diana is trying to achieve for society in her work.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096464/,['Shawn Slovo'],['Chris Menges'],"['Barbara Hershey', 'David Suchet', 'Jodhi May', 'Jeroen Krabbé', 'Nadine Chalmers', 'Maria Pilar', 'Kate Fitzpatrick', 'Tim Roth', 'Phyllis Naidoo', 'Linda Mvusi']",1988-06-17,"['United Kingdom', 'Zimbabwe']","['Atlantic Entertainment Group', 'British Screen Productions', 'Channel Four Films']","['Coming-of-Age', 'Drama']",1988,6,17

For Peter and his wife, both of whom are deaf, a surgical ear implant for their 5-year-old daughter Heather means a choice between two worlds: an unfamiliar hearing world; and the deaf world, a robust culture in its own right united by a uniquely visual and artistic language. Heather Artinian--precocious, vivacious, and avidly curious about implant surgery--is caught between her deaf parents and her hearing grandparents as they argue passionately about her future.

While Microsoft's Windows became the most widely used operating system for personal computers in the world, many experts took issue with Microsoft's strict policies regarding licensing, ownership, distribution, and alteration of their software. The objections of many high-profile technology experts, most notably Richard Stallman, led to what has become known as ""the Open Source Movement,"" which is centered on the belief that computer software should be free both in the economic and intellectual senses of the word. Eventually, one of Stallman's admirers, Linus Torvalds, created a new operating system called Linux, a freely distributed software which many programmers consider to be markedly superior to Windows. Revolution OS is a documentary that examines the genesis of the Open Source Movement, and explores and explains the technical and intellectual issues involved in a manner understandable to computer aficionados and non-techheads alike.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0308808/,['J.T.S.

His companion, the vain Elder Van Pelt, seeks to become the assistant to the mission president (the top post available) as soon as possible, and he receives letters from three girlfriends he left behind. The capable Elder Rogers has become disillusioned and inattentive to his duties ever since a previous missionary companion returned to America, looked up and married Elder Rogers' girlfriend. As a result he is simply marking time until he returns home in a few weeks time. The three meet Elder Rogers' new companion, Elder Calhoun, in the train station. This new elder is a nerdy but enthusiastic ""greenie"" that has just arrived from the Missionary Training Center (MTC) in Utah. Unfortunately his training did not give him much fluency in the Dutch language, but as luck would have it, the first person he approaches to proselytize is a fellow American named Kyle.

tt0402406,The Nomi Song,1h 38m,7.4,"Having failed to break into professional opera in his native Germany (where, as an usher in West Berlin's Deutsche Oper, he would serenade the staff after the real performances were over) the diminutive Klaus Nomi headed for NYC in 1972. The vibrant New Wave/avant-garde gestalt of the mid/late '70's East Village proved to be fertile ground for the development of his unique talents. Working by day as a high-end pastry chef, Nomi began to stage his outlandish performances, first launching himself upon an unsuspecting public at the New Wave Vaudeville in 1978. The hip and cynical young audience was stunned by this weird combination of falsetto arias, booming classical orchestration, Kraftwerk-style electronica, futuristic costumes and outer space imagery. An odd assortment of artists, choreographers, designers, songwriters and musicians jumped on to the Nomi bandwagon and the phenomenon began to take off - first attracting thousands to South Manhattan events (including performances at the legendary Max's Kansas City) and culminating in a recording contract with the French division of RCA. With the release 'Klaus Nomi' in 1981 and 'Simple Man' in 1982, it looked as if Nomi was on the verge of superstardom. Having established himself in Europe, he made a triumphant return to New York City. But Nomi's moment of glory proved to be his swansong. Within only a few months Nomi had succumbed to the ravages of AIDS. One of the first celebrities to be killed by this mysterious new disease, Nomi died a lonely death, largely abandoned by those who had seen him as a passport to their own success. Today, the otherworldliness of 'The Cold Song' and 'Dido's Lament' is like an ethereal voice calling from beyond the grave.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0402406/,['Andrew Horn'],['Andrew Horn'],"['Klaus Nomi', 'Ann Magnuson', 'David Bowie', 'Gabriele Lafari', 'David McDermott', 'Page Wood', 'Tony Frere', 'Man Parrish', 'Kristian Hoffman', 'Ron Johnsen']",2005-03-24,['Germany'],"['ARTE', 'CV Films', 'Cameo Filmproduktion']","['Biography', 'Documentary', 'Music']",2005,3,24

Karnail Singh was one such suspect, who claims that he has had no hand in any terrorism activity, but is nevertheless pursued by the Police, leaving his widowed mom, Kartar, and sister, Parsan, to fend for themselves by running a Dhaba and being subjected to harassment at the hands of Inspector Ujagar Singh, while the village Mukhiya wants Parsan to get married to a much older Narang Singh. Parsan's problems are resolved when Indian Army Captain Nihal Singh intervenes, and marries her, even though her mom, beaten senseless by the Police, passes away on the day of the marriage. Months later, Nihal must re-locate to Siachen, leaving behind a pregnant Parsan. Once in Siachen, he gets news that Parsan has been attacked and is hospitalized.

Caltech is annually considered one of the top 5 academic institutions in the world yet its athletic department always takes a back seat to the achievements of its world renowned faculty, Nobel prize winners, and advancements in the world of science and technology. The film ""Real Genius (1985)"" was a not-so-subtle take on Caltech life. To the casual fan, the team might sound like a bad joke. There are more valedictorians on the team than players with high school basketball experience. In fact, the 5 seniors did not play high school basketball, yet all five are major contributors to the team. They are roundly mocked by opposing fans as ""nerds playing basketball"" (the few fans that decide its even worth it to show up). However, this season would mark an amazing turnaround from just two years ago when the team would lose by an average margin of over 60 points per game. Against remarkable odds and adversity, the players and coaches dedication, discipline, heart, and yes, SKILL would make for one of the most exciting seasons in school history.

Of the twenty million people in Ghana, two million are disabled. This is the story of one disabled man whose mission-and purpose- is to change all that forever. In Emmanuel's Gift, filmmakers Lisa Lax and Nancy Stern have uncovered a story as compelling as it is important. Narrated by Oprah Winfrey, the film chronicles the life of Emmanuel Ofosu Yeboah, a young Ghanaian man born with a severely deformed right leg, who today, against incalculable odds, is opening minds, hearts and doors-and effecting social and political change throughout his country. While Emmanuel's message is vital: people with disabilities are valuable contributors to any society, his method is inspirational. Emmanuel begins his quest with a bicycle ride, over 600 kilometers, across Ghana with one leg-and continues to spread his vision with grit and resolve. Lisa Lax and Nancy Stern have been documenting Emmanuel's plight for over a year, having shot over 100 hours of powerful imagery. The film includes original footage shot in Ghana, California, Oregon and New York, as well as photographs and other acquired film/video of Emmanuel's early years. Through it all, they have created an intimate insight into the mind and heart of a visionary whose unforgettable journey transcends continents and cultures and becomes each of ours to share.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0447016/,"['Lisa Lax', 'Elizabeth Massie', 'Nancy Stern Winters']","['Lisa Lax', 'Nancy Stern Winters']","['Robin Williams', 'Oprah Winfrey']",2007-06-30,['United States'],['Lookalike Productions'],['Documentary'],2007,6,30

tt1262863,Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story,1h 26m,7.6,"The Murrow, Polk, and IDA Award-winning documentary Boogie Man is about Lee Atwater, a blues-playing rogue whose rise from the South to Chairman of the GOP made him a political rock star. He mentored George W. Bush and Karl Rove while leading the Republican party to historic victories, helping make liberal a dirty word, and transforming the way America elects our Presidents. In interviews with Republicans and friends of Atwater, Boogie Man examines his role in America's shift to the right.

It begins in 1993, when a young man from Belgium looking to change his life has an unexpected encounter in Central Park. He meets a hawk. Not just any hawk, but a wild Redtail, a fierce predator that has not lived in the City for almost a hundred years. Compelled to follow this extraordinary creature, he buys a video camera and sets out to track the hawk. Little does he know that the journey will take him almost twenty years and lead him down many trails of life, death, birth, hope, and redemption. Affectionately known to New Yorkers as Pale Male, the hawk becomes a magnificent obsession and a metaphor for triumph against all odds. His nest, perched on a posh 5th Avenue co-op, starts out as a novel curiosity to a handful of avid birdwatchers but becomes an international tourist destination - a place of pilgrimage. Then, on a December afternoon without warning, in the space of half an hour, the building dismantles Pale Male's beloved nest. In a wingbeat, media from around the world assemble on 5th Avenue to cover the unprecedented protest. Gathering behind Pale Male is an army of birdwatchers, movie stars, poets, children, dogs, and late night comedy show hosts. What unfolds next, as they say, could only happen in New York.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1699158/,['Janet Hess'],['Frederic Lilien'],"['Alexander Fisher', 'Lincoln Karim', 'Charles Kennedy', 'David Letterman', 'Frederic Lilien', 'Mary Tyler Moore', ""Conan O'Brien"", 'Regis Philbin', 'Kelly Ripa', 'Brian Williams']",2009-05-09,['United States'],['Birdjail Productions'],['Documentary'],2009,5,9

tt1433001,The Cartel,1h 30m,7.5,"American public schools have been growing progressively worse. According to the U.S. Department of Education national testing, only 35% of American high school seniors are proficient in reading, based on 2006 data. And fewer than one-in-four, 23%, are proficient in math. On the global stage, America ranks last in educational effectiveness among large industrialized countries despite the highest spending per student in the world. It presents a conundrum: How has the richest and most innovative society on earth suddenly lost the ability to teach its children at a level that other modern countries consider ""basic""? If the problem is that we're not spending enough on schools, which many people believe, it's instructive to study the U.S. state that spends more than any other per student: New Jersey With spending as high as $483,000 per classroom (confirmed by NJ Education Department records for 2005-06), New Jersey students fare only slightly better than the national average in reading and math, and rank 37th in average SAT scores. And not even half of NJ's high school freshmen, despite the state's enormous ""investment,"" are academically ready for college four years later. The fact is much of the public considers teacher salaries and overall education budgets to be the same thing -- if you're for raising one, you must be for raising the other. But as the film shows, in many cases 80-90% of the spending goes somewhere besides teacher salaries. In fact billions of dollars, as confirmed by independent audits, are wasted.

Prisoners compete on wild-broncs and bucking bulls, risking life-long injuries.

To make matters worse, lions, unlike elephants, which are far more numerous, have virtually no protection under government mandate or through international accords. This is the jumping-off point for a disturbing, well-researched and beautifully made cri de coeur from husband and wife team Dereck and Beverly Joubert, award-winning filmmakers from Botswana who have been Explorers-in-Residence at National Geographic for more than four years. Pointing to poaching as a primary threat while noting the lion's pride of place on the list for eco-tourists-an industry that brings in 200 billion dollars per year worldwide-the Jouberts build a solid case for both the moral duty we have to protect lions (as well as other threatened ""big cats,"" tigers among them) and the economic sense such protection would make. And when one takes into account the fact that big cats are at the very top of the food chain-and that their elimination would wreak havoc on all species below them, causing a complete ecosystem collapse-the need takes on a supreme urgency.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1692928/,['Dereck Joubert'],['Dereck Joubert'],['Jeremy Irons'],2011-02-18,"['United States', 'Botswana']",['National Geographic Films'],"['Nature Documentary', 'Documentary', 'Family']",2011,2,18

Whether exploring the pulsating energy of the city or contemplating quiet moments in the country, her artful camera compositions and the lyrical pacing of the film allow us to truly engage and process the foreign land on our own terms. Documenting Uganda while it deals with day-to-day realities and the aftermath of its civil wars, Takesue, well aware of her perspective as an outsider, strives for simple, unadorned honesty. Employing a largely observational style, Takesue allows the sight and sounds-and the people-of Uganda to speak for themselves. Usually the people she records simply ignore the camera, but when someone does engage-whether it's a group of school children clamoring for their moment in front of the lens or a young man asking the title question-the barriers between filmmaker, subject, and audience give way for breathtaking cinematic epiphanies.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1675311/,,['Kimi Takesue'],,2012-03-02,"['United States', 'Uganda']","['Kimikat Productions', 'Lane Street Pictures']",['Documentary'],2012,3,2

Abbie grew up in hospitals, cared for by her protective mother and father. She then came into her own in honky tonks, selling merchandise for her dad's band. But just like any other 18 year-old, Abbie yearns for a life of her own. Butterfly Girl charts Abbie's journey towards a new understanding of how she must balance her past with her future, her parents with her independence, and her disease with her desires.

As they prune, the men chat about food, the weather, the world and they share their knowledge of horticulture. Surrounded by vegetable patches, citrus trees in the historical orangery, the orchard and lush grapevines we're swept along by their passion, dedication and knowledge that make up the essential ingredients of successfully maintaining a large vegetable garden. Fifteen years they have spent working on the pear arbour. Will it finally close over this year? Despite his old age, the pruning master is still inexhaustible and driven. As he worries about the loss of centuries of knowledge, the younger gardener makes a real effort of soaking up all this knowledge and passing it on. Meanwhile the seasons go by. The gardening lady works the vegetable patches, the citrus trees leave their winter accommodation and we get to meet the Apple Blossom Beetle. The grand finale is in August with its seemingly never-ending harvest and its abundance of taste, colour and scent. As peace slowly returns to the natural world, it's business as usual for the gardener amid the falling leaves and the white frost on the branches.

When someone is willing to disturb the status quo and stand for the dream of a free and secure world, who will stand with them? DISTURBING THE PEACE is a story of the human potential unleashed when we stop participating in a story that no longer serves us and, with the power of our convictions, take action to create new possibilities. DISTURBING THE PEACE follows former enemy combatants - Israeli soldiers from elite units and Palestinian fighters, many of whom served years in prison - who have joined together to challenge the status quo and say ""enough."" The film reveals their transformational journeys from soldiers committed to armed battle to nonviolent peace activists, leading to the creation of Combatants for Peace.

I'll Push You is an up-close and personal look into the dynamics of a life-long friendship between of two best friends - Justin Skeesuck and Patrick Gray - as they travel across El Camino de Santiago. This feature-length documentary covers the struggle of the 34-day, 500-mile hike across mountains, deserts, hills, and valleys and features perspectives from family and friends.

The parallel paths of Patrick's experience in Spain and Justin's life journey come together in a singular moment to reveal to Patrick something unezpected. The story's beautiful cinematography is set to poignant music tracks that underscore, perfectly, the inspiring example of generosity and vulnerability on display. The film is an intimate portrait of an epic journey and explores the true meaning of friendship, generosity, and vulnerability. It's a one-of-a-kind documentary chronicling their pilgrimage, which will resonate with viewers craving stories of faith, hope, love, and the power of community.

Jones and D-Man in the Waters is a feature documentary that traces the history and legacy of one of the most important works of art to come out of the age of AIDS - Bill T. Jones' tour de force ballet ""D-Man in the Waters"". In 1989, ""D-Man in the Waters"" gave physical manifestation to the fear, anger, grief, and hope for salvation that the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Company felt as they were embattled by the AIDS pandemic. As a group of young dancers reconstructs the dance, they learn about this oft forgotten history and deepen their understanding of the power of art in a time of plague. Bill T. Jones is arguably the most socially, politically and emotionally compelling choreographer alive today. Thirty years ago, he embedded motifs of risk and sacrifice, love, loss and resurrection in the choreography for ""D-Man in the Waters"". Through an extraordinary series of interviews, archival material, and uniquely powerful cinematography of movement, this 90-minute, lyrical documentary uses the story of this dance to illustrate the triumph of the human spirit in art and in the community. Today, by learning the dance, a new generation reinvigorates the spirit of a community fighting to survive.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14551164/,"['Arthur Aviles', 'Johari Briggs', 'Seán Curran']","['Tom Hurwitz', 'Rosalynde LeBlanc']","['Arthur Aviles', 'Johari Briggs', 'Seán Curran', 'Lawrence Goldhuber', 'Gregg Hubbard', 'Heidi Latsky', 'Janet Lilly', 'Betsy McCracken', 'Antonio Brown', 'Rena Butler']",2021-07-16,['United States'],['Dancing/On Air'],['Documentary'],2021,7,16

tt34772319,Becoming Katharine Graham,1h 32m,8.4,"Becoming Katharine Graham tells the story of a painfully shy woman's accidental rise to power and how it changed history.

Born in 1917, Katharine Graham-known as ""Kay""-was raised to adhere to the expectation that men would have careers, and women would raise the family. Kay, like most other women at the time, abided by these societal norms. But the course of her life would drastically change once her father, financier Eugene Meyer, bought a struggling newspaper at public auction in 1933.

This struggling newspaper was The Washington Post, and it was on the brink of collapse. The paper's performance incrementally improved under her father's leadership; Mr. Meyer poured his own money into the business to ensure its growth. Then, in 1946, Mr. Meyer handed control of the newspaper over to the next generation. A product of his own times, Mr. Meyer never considered giving the ""Publisher"" title to his daughter, even though she had quietly participated in the initial struggle to keep the paper afloat and had worked as a journalist both in San Francisco and at The Washington Post. Instead, he bequeathed the title and two-thirds ownership of the paper to her husband Phil Graham exclaiming that ""no man should work for his wife."" The performance of the paper grew exponentially under Phil's leadership, but his suicide in 1963 left Kay with a leaderless newspaper and four young children, forcing Kay to decide whether to take over the cherished family business herself or sell it.

Although a self-proclaimed ""doormat wife,"" Kay made the difficult and unprecedented decision to keep the paper in the family and run it herself. She initially imagined she would serve as a figurehead-a somewhat silent placeholder-until her eldest son, Don, could take her place as Publisher. Yet, over the course of the following decades, Kay proved to be a vocal and incredibly important leader of The Washington Post. She worked hard to learn the newspaper business inside out, while simultaneously gaining confidence in her own abilities and earning respect within the male-dominated industry.

Over the course of her career, she rose to become one of the most powerful newspaper publishers of the 20th century. Kay had the courage to publish the ""Pentagon Papers"", stand behind the paper's historic Watergate reporting, and withstand the infamous 1975 pressmen's strike that threatened the very existence of the paper.

At its heart, Becoming Katharine Graham highlights pivotal events of the 1970s that occurred under Kay's leadership difficulties she endured as one of the first female leaders in corporate America. Featuring interviews with colleagues, friends, and family, and relying heavily on archival footage to bring Kay's own voice to the forefront, the film presents a nuanced portrait of Kay and pays homage to her inspiring role as a trailblazer for women in both journalism and corporate leadership.
